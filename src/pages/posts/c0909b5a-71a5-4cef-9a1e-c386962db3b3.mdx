You make a fair point. While mentorship can be incredibly valuable, it is not an absolute necessity for achieving success, especially in text-based fields. Here are some insights on becoming successful without a formal mentorship:

1. Self-Directed Learning:
   - In the absence of a mentor, you can take charge of your own learning process. Identify the skills and knowledge you need to develop, and seek out resources like online tutorials, books, articles, and online courses.
   - The internet provides a wealth of information and learning opportunities that can help you acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed.

2. Peer Learning and Networking:
   - Connect with like-minded individuals, whether through online communities, forums, or local meetups. Engage in discussions, share insights, and learn from each other's experiences.
   - Collaborating with peers can provide valuable feedback, new perspectives, and opportunities for growth.

3. Deliberate Practice:
   - Consistent, focused practice is key to developing expertise, even without a mentor. Identify areas you need to improve and devote dedicated time to practicing and honing your skills.
   - Seek out feedback, constructive criticism, and opportunities to apply your skills in real-world scenarios.

4. Continuous Improvement:
   - Adopt a growth mindset and continuously seek ways to improve your craft. Stay up-to-date with industry trends, experiment with new techniques, and be open to feedback and learning from your mistakes.
   - Regularly reflect on your progress and identify areas for further development.

5. Resourcefulness and Problem-Solving:
   - When faced with challenges, develop the ability to research, analyze, and find creative solutions on your own. This can help you become self-reliant and adaptable in your pursuit of success.
   - Embrace the thrill of problem-solving and see it as an opportunity to expand your skills and knowledge.

6. Passion and Perseverance:
   - Cultivate a genuine passion for your chosen field. This intrinsic motivation can sustain you through the ups and downs of your journey, even without a formal mentor.
   - Persistence and resilience in the face of obstacles can be powerful drivers of success.

Remember, while mentorship can be invaluable, it is not the only path to success, especially in text-based fields. By taking a proactive, self-directed approach, leveraging your network, and continuously improving your skills, you can thrive and achieve your goals without a formal mentorship program.
