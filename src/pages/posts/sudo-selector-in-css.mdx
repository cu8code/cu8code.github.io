1. **::before**:
   - This pseudo-element inserts content before the content of the selected element.
   - It's commonly used to add decorative elements or textual content before an element.
   - You can define its style using CSS properties like `content`, `display`, `position`, `background`, etc.
   - Example:
     ```css
     .element::before {
         content: "Before text";
         display: block;
         background-color: #ccc;
     }
     ```

2. **::after**:
   - This pseudo-element inserts content after the content of the selected element.
   - It's often used for decorative purposes or to add additional content to an element.
   - Like '::before', you can style it using various CSS properties.
   - Example:
     ```css
     .element::after {
         content: "After text";
         display: block;
         color: red;
     }
     ```

1. **::first-line**: This pseudo-element targets the first line of text within an element. It allows you to style only the first line, such as changing its font, color, or adding decorations.

    ```css
    p::first-line {
        font-weight: bold;
        color: blue;
    }
    ```

2. **::first-letter**: Similar to `::first-line`, `::first-letter` targets the first letter of the text content within an element. It's often used for decorative purposes or for drop caps.

    ```css
    p::first-letter {
        font-size: 150%;
        color: red;
    }
    ```

3. **::placeholder**: This pseudo-element targets the placeholder text in an input field or textarea. It allows you to style the placeholder text separately from the input text.

    ```css
    input::placeholder {
        color: #999;
        font-style: italic;
    }
    ```

4. **::selection**: This pseudo-element allows you to style the portion of a document that has been highlighted by the user. It's commonly used to customize the appearance of selected text.

    ```css
    ::selection {
        background-color: #ffcc00;
        color: #333;
    }
    ```

5. **::marker**: This pseudo-element targets the marker box of a list item. It allows you to style the bullet or numbering of list items.

    ```css
    ul::marker {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```
